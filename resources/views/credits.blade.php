        Hello! ðŸ‘‹

        <br><br>

        Thank you so much for checking out my little side-project. I hope you enjoy how it turned out.
        This was all made in a span of a couple of days, like from start to finish. Even though this
        is a side-project, I had a lot of fun making it.

        <br><br>

        If you are interested in how it was made, check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/safeboot/dropdb" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-300 hover:text-indigo-400 transition duration-300">open-source repository</a>,
        and while you're there, feel free to contribute if you have ideas, or if you find any bugs. Also feel free to
        contact me via Discord (@safeboot) or via one of the emails in the footer! :D

        <br><br>

        I would like to thank the following people for helping and supporting me out with this project:
